    "My solution reads the raw file, normalizes it into a float array and then applies demosaicing to convert the Bayer pattern into a full RGB image. It does white balancing, applies inverse gamma curve and writes the final image to a file in JPEG format. For debugging and for the comparison code, I used chatgpt to get some metrics to compare the ground truth output images to the one the pipeline produces."
